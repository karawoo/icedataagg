- what to do about samples where we're missing photic zone info?

** How to aggregate data into ice-covered vs. stratified:
   - ice-covered: use ice-on/ice-off data available on NSIDC

   - stratified: Steph looked at some old calculations of difference between 0 and 50 m temperature. Consistently July, August, and September can be considered to be stratified.
   - photic zone:
     - light extinction coefficient: kd = 1.7/secchi
     - photic zone: PZ = ln(1000) / kd
