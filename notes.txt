Ice Data Aggregation Notes -*- mode: org -*-

- remove phyto codes without chloroplasts?
- should standardize TotZoop.Count and Phyto.CellCount since they are analogous fields for zooplankton/phytoplankton yet have very different names
- need to make sure we're clear about whether percentages sum to 1 or 100 -- Aaron and I think we should sum to 1 and call it "proportion" instead of "percent" since people will probably calculate proportions first and multiply by 100 to get percent
- SamplePeriod.n - how are we defining this? does one sample = 1 date? or if they did multiple samples at different depths does one sample = 1 tow?
- reporting number of samples: have two fields: number of dates and average number of depths sampled per date
- have free-form field for people to describe any weirdness in number of replicates
- make sure to normalize by number of samples (liters) when calculating total phyto counts.
- use 800 m for StationDepth (Hampton 2008)

- there's a problem with double counts in 1945 (at least) -- codes 15 and 16 are double-counts, but it appears that in 1945 (and maybe other years, I haven't checked) they are some of the only Epischura codes used. As a result the counts in 1945 in the final aggregated data set are all 0. need to decide what to do about this (probably keep codes 15 and 16 in 1945)
- Important note about the way I aggregate the zooplankton data: any grouping by year and season will not behave as expected if there are cases where ice-on was early and sampling occurred in December. For example, 1989-12-31 will be grouped with the previous ice-on season rather than the one ending in spring of 1990. In this data it doesn't appear that there are any such cases, however when I have time to come back to this I should do it in a way that's robust to this issue.

- stations with multiple n -- we ask for the number of samples that's being aggregated, but what if they sampled some things x times and other things y times (e.g. secchi 10x but zooplankton only 5, or something)?
- if there are samples for which there is no secchi/photic zone info -- discard these? or try to interpolate secchi? - interpolate using average photic zone for that season
- don't include ciliates (or harpacticoids, bdelloids, cysts, "various protists") in zooplankton data because they're counted too inconsistently
- if there are different sample start and end dates for different parameters use the first start and last end for the "sample dates" field
- there's only iceon/iceoff data through 2006 but chla data goes to 2008
- no secchi data before 1964 or in 1984 - for these just use averages from the whole time series in winter or summer. there's been no trend in secchi so this should be fine
- iceon/iceoff data only goes to 2006 but secchi and chlorophyll go to 2008. for these few years look at gaps in sampling in winter to determine iceon and iceoff for 2007 and 2008
- need to figure out a better way to subset the data based on ice date ranges. currently I merge data and ice dates by year using iceoff year and then subset the data based on whether the date falls within the ice date range /in that row/, but this will lose any samples in a given year when the lake froze before the end of December.

- need to add an "other copepod" category to the zooplankton data (so there will be calanoid, cyclopoid, and other)

* 2014-09-30
- what to do about samples where we're missing photic zone info?

** How to aggregate data into ice-covered vs. stratified:
   - ice-covered: use ice-on/ice-off data available on NSIDC

   - stratified: Steph looked at some old calculations of difference between 0 and 50 m temperature. Consistently July, August, and September can be considered to be stratified.
   - photic zone:
     - light extinction coefficient: kd = 1.7/secchi
     - photic zone: PZ = ln(1000) / kd
