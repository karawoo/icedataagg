# Ice Data Aggregation

This is a place for me to get long term data from Lake Baikal aggregated to match the data template for the [Under Ice Ecology](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/underice) synthesis project. Maybe I'll make it into a package eventually. This repo doesn't contain the actual data because unfortunately I can't share it.
