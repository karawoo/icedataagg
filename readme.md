# Lake Baikal long-term data aggregation

This is a place for me to get long term data from Lake Baikal aggregated to
match the data template for the
[Under Ice Ecology](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/underice) synthesis project.
Maybe I'll make it into a package eventually. This repo doesn't contain the
actual data because unfortunately I can't share it.

See [icetest](https://github.com/karawoo/icetest) for my data validation
package.

`funs.R` contains all the custom functions I wrote for this project.

`aggregate_data.R` does the aggregation.
